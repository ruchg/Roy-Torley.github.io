  <p class = "lead">Choosing the correct selection method to make changes to objects is an essential skill
  to develop. In this tutorial, you will learn how to correctly locate and select objects using
  the Selection tools, as well as protect objects by hiding and locking. Later, you will build
  on these methods by integrating layers.</p>

  <p>In this tutorial on the work area, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>differentiate when to use the Selection, Edit path by nodes, or
    Select by grouping tools.</li>
    <li>group and ungroup items.</li>
    <li>clone items with the Select tool.</li>
    <li>lock and hide items for organizational purposes.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<header>
  <h2>Prepping for this tutorial</h2>
<p>You might have heard the saying, "You have to select it, to affect it."
When changing colors, sizes, adding effects or any number of attributes,
you must first select the object to which you are applying the changes.
Consider this tutorial a primer in the fundamentals of the Selection tools.
More advanced selection techniques using layers are discussed in Tutorial 7,
&ldquo;Working with Layers.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>Using the Select Tool</h2>
</header>
<ol start = "3">
  <li><p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >). Position the mouse over the different star
  shapes without clicking. Note the crossed arrow icon that appears as you pass
  over objects, indicating that there is an object that can be selected under
  the pointer.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/YellowStarSelectTool.gif" alt = "Yellow star with
      Select tool" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Select tool with crossed arrow icon.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Click on the yellow star in the upper left corner. A bounding box with eight
handles appears.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/YellowStarRubberbandBox.gif" alt = "Yellow star with
      bounding box" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>The bounding box</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>The bounding box is used for transformations such as resizing and rotating;
it also indicates that this item is selected and ready to be edited. This could
mean changing the size, color, position, or any number of other things.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), click on the star to the right and notice
  that the first star is now deselected and only the second star is
  selected.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/SecondStarSelected.gif" alt = "Second yellow star
      selected" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Second star selected.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>Add another star to the selection by holding down the &lt;Shift&gt; key

      <figcaption>Add other items to a selection by holding down the
      &lt;Shift&gt; key.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Reposition the stars by clicking in the center of either selected star
  and dragging. Since both are selected, they travel together.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p>Note: When you select an item without a fill, you must click on the
stroke (border).</p>
</aside>

<ol start = "7" >
  <li><p>Deselect the stars by clicking on the canvas where there are no objects.
  Alternatively, press &lt;Esc&gt; (the Escape key).</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Revert by choosing <u>F</u>ile > Re<u>v</u>ert. An alert box will appear
  warning you that you will lose any changes made to your document &mdash; are
  you sure you want to reload the document&hellip;? Click on OK. File
  <b>YellowStars.svg</b> is reloaded and the stars appear in their original
  positions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<header>
  <h2>Marquee Select</h2>
</header>
<p>Some selections may be easier to make by creating a marquee around the
objects that you want to select.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>With the same file, <b>YellowStars.svg</b>, open, switch to the
  Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool"
  width = "26" >). Instead of &lt;Shift&gt;+clicking to select the first two
  stars, position the mouse above the upper left star and then click and drag
  downward and to the right to create a marquee that completely encloses the
  two stars.</p>
  <figure>

  <h2>Grouping Objects</h2>
</header>
<p>You can combine several objects into a group so that they are treated as a
single unit. This way, you can move or transform a number of objects without
affecting their attributes or positions relative to each other.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>With the same file, <b>YellowStars.svg</b>, open, switch to the Select
  tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width =
  "26" >). Click outside the top left of the first star and drag a marquee that
  encompasses each star on the first row to select all three.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup, then
  press &lt;Esc&gt;.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), click on the first star. Notice that since
  it is grouped with the other two stars, all three become selected.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AllThreeStarsGrouped.gif"
    alt = "Grouped stars with rubberband box"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Click one, all in the group become selected.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<header>
  <h2>Adding to a Group</h2>
</header>
<p>Groups can also be nested; that is, they can be grouped within other objects
or groups to form larger groups.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>With the top group of three stars still selected, &lt;Shift&gt;+click
  on the first star in the second row.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AddingToTheGroup1.gif"
    alt = "Adding a star to a group of three"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  <p>With this added to the selection, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt;
  <u>G</u>roup.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AddingToTheGroup2.gif" alt = "Adding a star to a group
    of three" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>&lt;Shift&gt;+click on the middle star in the second row and also
  choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Press &lt;Esc&gt; when finished.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now, click on any of the five grouped stars. See how the top and middle
  rows of stars are enclosed in the bounding box.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click anywhere outside the box to deselect the group, and then click on
  the third star in the second row. Only that star is enclosed in the marquee.
  It has not been included in the group yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>&lt;Shift&gt;+click on one of the grouped stars to include the group
  to the "group of one." The bounding box encloses the two top rows of stars
  and includes a smaller box highlighting the one "special star."</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AddingToTheGroup3.gif" alt = "Adding a star to a group
    of three" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click outside the box and then click on the third star in the second
  row. The box now encloses the top two rows of stars, indicating that the last
  star you included is now part of the group.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You have created groups within groups. This is a common technique used when
designing artwork, but can be confusing when editing existing files where
grouping has been used.</p>

<ol start = "9" >
  <li><p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" 	width = "26">) and click on any one of the grouped stars.
  They all become selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click off the stars to a blank area on the artboard to deselect
  them.</p></li>
  <li><p>Ungroup items by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup. Note that
  you will have to repeat this action for each of the groups created. In other
  words, to get these back to individual stars, we have to choose <u>U</u>ngroup
  four times.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p><b>Note:</b> Read Tutorial 7, &ldquo;Working with Layers.&rdquo; If
you have a complex setup of nested groups and want to ungroup just one item,
you can locate and select that item much more easily using layers, and you
don&rsquo;t have to ungroup.</p>

  <h2>The Edit Path by Nodes Tool</h2>
</header>
<p>There are instances when you want to select and manipulate specific line
segments and nodes without affecting other paths and nodes in an object. You
can with the Edit Path by Nodes Tool (Node tool, for short). In this part of
the tutorial, you will select certain points on the stars in the top row of
stars used in the last example, and manipulate them.  Before you start, you
need to know that regular geometric shapes, such as the stars, are described
internally by scalable vector equations that need only the positions of one
inner and one outer point (node) to fully determine the shape of the star.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/StarAnatomy.gif" alt = "Anatomy of a star showing nodes"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
<p>To manipulate individual paths and nodes on a star, or other type of regular
polygon for that matter, you need to strip the star or polygon of its original
equations so that it is represented internally as a series of individual paths
and nodes. The original describing equations are eliminated, so there is no
previous computer knowledge of what the shape was. With this new internal
representation, you can now change the position of individual nodes.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Click on <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen and open the
  <b>Tutorial02Image01.svg</b> file you downloaded earlier.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Marquee select the three stars in the top row.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Top3StarsSelected.gif" alt = "Selecting the top 3 stars"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Selecting the top 3 stars</figcaption>

    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Top 3 stars selected</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the three stars still selected, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt;
  <u>O</u>bject to path.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt =
  "Edit Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >).</p>
  <p>The selected stars are now shown as paths and nodes.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/StarPathsAndNodes.gif"
    alt = "The top stars are now paths and nodes."
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>The top 3 stars appearing as paths and nodes</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the top point of the third selected star and drag it to the
  right.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DraggingPointToTheRight.gif"
    alt = "Dragging a single star point to the right"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  <p>Note how the selected node turns red, indicating that it is active. When
  you release the left mouse button and move the cursor off the node, it turns
  blue to indicate that it is still active and ready to be moved.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo: Move nodes to undo your latest
  action of repositioning the star point.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the white background to deselect the stars.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Now click on the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
  alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >) and reselect the top three stars.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
  Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >). Note how the stars now show nodes at all
  inner and outer points.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Node tool, drag a marquee around the top points of the three
  selected stars.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/GroupSelectingWithEditPathsTool.gif"
    alt = "Group selecting with the Edit Paths tool" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Release the left mouse button. The selected points are now colored
  blue, indicating that they are now active.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/TopPointsSelected.gif"
    alt = "Top points of stars selected" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Drag the top point of the right-most star to a new location. See how
  all the selected top points move in parallel with the one node you are
  moving.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/GroupMove.gif" alt = "Group moving nodes" class =
  "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  <p>Experiment by clicking (and &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking ) on different nodes
  and moving them around.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This grouping technique is handy when you need to move one or more parts of
one or more items the same distance in the same direction. You can also select
more than one node by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the nodes with the Node tool.
When you use this technique,</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>select your items with the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >),</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path,</p></li>
    <li><p>click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
    Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >),</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>use the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
    Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >) to select the nodes you want to
    manipulate, and</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>move the nodes as you need.</p></li>
  </ol>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the positioning, you can always choose <u>E</u>dit
&gt; <u>U</u>ndo: your latest action. A quick alternative to using the Edit
menu is to press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z, the shortcut key, to undo your last action.
(Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z multiple times to undo multiple actions.)</p>

  <h2>Applying Selection Techniques</h2>
</header>
<p>In this next part of the tutorial, you will use some of the techniques
discussed as well as several others.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Download the art file
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/Doggie_pieces.svg"><b>Doggie_pieces.svg</b></a>
  to your computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Make sure that the entire canvas is visible by pressing the <b>4</b>
  key (the shortcut key for the <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt;
  <u>D</u>rawing command). On the right you see the completed project, on the
  left are the objects needed to create the finished dog.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Doggie_pieces.gif" alt = "Pieces of a cartoon dog"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Start this lesson by hiding the Command bar, Tools Control bar,
  Toolbox, and color palette; you won&rsquo;t need them for this part of the
  tutorial. Hold down &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+p to hide the palette, or hide
  the Commands bar, Tools Control bar, Toolbox, and color palette individually
  using the <u>V</u>iew &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide submenu.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), select the brownish-red circle. To avoid
  grabbing a bounding box handle and resizing the circle, click and drag the
  center of the circle to slide it to its new location as the nose of the
  dog.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), drag both ears, the tuft of hair, and the
  mouth into position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DoggieHalfwayThere.gif"
    alt = "Doggie cartoon halfway constructed"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Use the Select tool to move parts into place.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</li>
</ol>

<aside><p><b>Note</b>: Be careful with the mouth. It contains two objects, so
with the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection
tool" width = "26" >), &lt;Shift&gt;+click to select the top and bottom objects,
and move them together.</p>
</aside>

<ol start = "6">
  <li><p>Select the dog&rsquo;s head (light brown shape), choose <u>O</u>bject
  &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click the Lock checkbox to keep the head
  in position. Click outside the bounding box to turn it off. You will not be
  able to select the dog&rsquo;s head until you choose <u>O</u>bject &gt;
  Unlock All. Leave it locked for now.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You are using the solid arrow, or Select tool (<img src =
"images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >), to activate
an entire object and move it. Each object that you select is made up of several
anchor points. To activate these anchor points individually, switch to the Node
tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width =
"26" >).</p>

<ol start = "7" >
  <li><p>Click on the anchor point in the first peak, or tuft, of hair. When
  the individual point is selected, it appears as a solid red diamond (active),
  whereas the other anchor points are gray diamonds (inactive). When you move
  the Node tool off the active node, the node&rsquo;s color changes to blue,
  indicating that it&rsquo;s still selected but not currently active. Click and
  drag the individual anchor point to change its position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/EditByDragging.gif"
    alt = "Pulling out a tuft of doggie hair"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Using the Node tool,<br>

  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Individually select other anchor points in the hair shape and position
  them in different directions. You are giving a ruffled look to the dog&rsquo;s
  hair.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/PulledDoggieHairs.gif"
    alt = "Doggie hairs pulled individually"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Moving individual anchor points.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</li>
  <li><p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >). The eye is made of several parts. Use
  either the marquee selection technique or the &lt;Shift&gt; key to select all
  three parts of the eye. Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup. Drag the eye
  into a position on the face to create a left eye.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>While still pressing the left mouse button (don&rsquo;t release it
  yet), press the space bar once. The eye is copied and can now be dragged to a
  new location. Drag the selected eye to the right to clone the left eye and
  position it as the right eye. Release the mouse button. The dog now has two
  eyes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p><b>Note</b>: If you also hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key when cloning,
  the newly cloned object is constrained and snaps to a straight, 90&deg;, or
  180&deg; angle. Also, if you need to create a multitude of similar objects,
  you can first click on the original object to select it but do not release
  the mouse button. Drag the mouse along and tap on the space bar to create
  copies of the original object. You can adjust their position later.</p>

  <h2>Hiding Selections</h2>
</header>
<p>As you create more complicated artwork, existing objects may get in the way
and make it difficult to make selections. A good technique when designing in
Inkscape is to Hide selected artwork, which can be done by selecting an object
with the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
"Selection tool" width = "26" >), choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject
Properties, and clicking on the Hide checkbox in the Object Properties dialog.
A hidden object can not be moved or selected; it is essentially as though that
object no longer exists on the canvas. Bring all hidden objects back at the
same time by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All.</p>
</aside>
<section>
<header>
  <h2>Advanced Selection Techniques</h2>
</header>
<p>When working on complex artwork, selections may become more difficult to
control. In this tutorial, we combine some of the tutorials already covered
with some additional features that will make selecting the correct items
easier.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Download file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/AlleenMaarDeBesteFriten.svg"><b>AlleenMaarDeBesteFriten.svg</b></a>
  to your computer. Have the Fill and Stroke dialog panel open.
  If it isn&rsquo;t visible, choose Window &gt; Fill and Stroke.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AlleenMaarDeFriten.gif" alt = "Just the French fries"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Note that the large words, <b>DE BESTE FRITEN</b>, cover and make it
  difficult to select items underneath. Using the Select tool (<img src =
  "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >), select the
