  <p class = "lead">Choosing the correct selection method to make changes to objects is an essential skill
  to develop. In this tutorial, you will learn how to correctly locate and select objects using
  the Selection tools, as well as protect objects by hiding and locking. Later, you will build
  on these methods by integrating layers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

<div>
  <p>In this tutorial on the work area, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>differentiate when to use the Selection, Edit path by nodes, or
    Select by grouping tools.</li>
    <li>group and ungroup items.</li>
    <li>clone items with the Select tool.</li>
    <li>lock and hide items for organizational purposes.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h2>Prepping for this tutorial</h2>
<p>You might have heard the saying, "You have to select it, to affect it."
When changing colors, sizes, adding effects or any number of attributes,
you must first select the object to which you are applying the changes.
Consider this tutorial a primer in the fundamentals of the Selection tools.
More advanced selection techniques using layers are discussed in Tutorial 7,
&ldquo;Working with Layers.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>Using the Select Tool</h2>
</header>
<ol start = "3">
  <li><p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >). Position the mouse over the different star
  shapes without clicking. Note the crossed arrow icon that appears as you pass
  over objects, indicating that there is an object that can be selected under
  the pointer.</p>

      bounding box" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>The bounding box</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>The bounding box is used for transformations such as resizing and rotating;
it also indicates that this item is selected and ready to be edited. This could
mean changing the size, color, position, or any number of other things.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), click on the star to the right and notice
  that the first star is now deselected and only the second star is
  selected.</p>
    <figure>

  <h2>Marquee Select</h2>
</header>
<p>Some selections may be easier to make by creating a marquee around the
objects that you want to select.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>With the same file, <b>YellowStars.svg</b>, open, switch to the
  Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool"
  width = "26" >). Instead of &lt;Shift&gt;+clicking to select the first two
  stars, position the mouse above the upper left star and then click and drag

  <h2>Grouping Objects</h2>
</header>
<p>You can combine several objects into a group so that they are treated as a
single unit. This way, you can move or transform a number of objects without
affecting their attributes or positions relative to each other.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>With the same file, <b>YellowStars.svg</b>, open, switch to the Select
  tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width =
  "26" >). Click outside the top left of the first star and drag a marquee that
  encompasses each star on the first row to select all three.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup, then
  press &lt;Esc&gt;.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), click on the first star. Notice that since
  it is grouped with the other two stars, all three become selected.</p>

  <h2>Adding to a Group</h2>
</header>
<p>Groups can also be nested; that is, they can be grouped within other objects
or groups to form larger groups.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>With the top group of three stars still selected, &lt;Shift&gt;+click
  on the first star in the second row.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AddingToTheGroup1.gif"
    alt = "Adding a star to a group of three"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  <p>With this added to the selection, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt;
  <u>G</u>roup.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AddingToTheGroup2.gif" alt = "Adding a star to a group
    of three" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>&lt;Shift&gt;+click on the middle star in the second row and also
  choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Press &lt;Esc&gt; when finished.</p></li>
  <li><p>Now, click on any of the five grouped stars. See how the top and middle
  rows of stars are enclosed in the bounding box.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click anywhere outside the box to deselect the group, and then click on
  the third star in the second row. Only that star is enclosed in the marquee.
  It has not been included in the group yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>&lt;Shift&gt;+click on one of the grouped stars to include the group
  to the "group of one." The bounding box encloses the two top rows of stars
  and includes a smaller box highlighting the one "special star."</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AddingToTheGroup3.gif" alt = "Adding a star to a group
    of three" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup.</p></li>
  <li><p>Click outside the box and then click on the third star in the second
  row. The box now encloses the top two rows of stars, indicating that the last
  star you included is now part of the group.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You have created groups within groups. This is a common technique used when
designing artwork, but can be confusing when editing existing files where
grouping has been used.</p>

<ol start = "9" >
  <li><p>Choose the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" 	width = "26">) and click on any one of the grouped stars.
  They all become selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click off the stars to a blank area on the artboard to deselect
  them.</p></li>
  <li><p>Ungroup items by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>U</u>ngroup. Note that
  you will have to repeat this action for each of the groups created. In other
  words, to get these back to individual stars, we have to choose <u>U</u>ngroup
  four times.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p><b>Note:</b> Read Tutorial 7, &ldquo;Working with Layers.&rdquo; If
you have a complex setup of nested groups and want to ungroup just one item,
you can locate and select that item much more easily using layers, and you
don&rsquo;t have to ungroup.</p>

  <h2>The Edit Path by Nodes Tool</h2>
</header>
<p>There are instances when you want to select and manipulate specific line
segments and nodes without affecting other paths and nodes in an object. You
can with the Edit Path by Nodes Tool (Node tool, for short). In this part of
the tutorial, you will select certain points on the stars in the top row of
stars used in the last example, and manipulate them.  Before you start, you
need to know that regular geometric shapes, such as the stars, are described
internally by scalable vector equations that need only the positions of one
inner and one outer point (node) to fully determine the shape of the star.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/StarAnatomy.gif" alt = "Anatomy of a star showing nodes"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
<p>To manipulate individual paths and nodes on a star, or other type of regular
polygon for that matter, you need to strip the star or polygon of its original
equations so that it is represented internally as a series of individual paths
and nodes. The original describing equations are eliminated, so there is no
previous computer knowledge of what the shape was. With this new internal
representation, you can now change the position of individual nodes.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Click on <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>O</u>pen and open the
  <b>Tutorial02Image01.svg</b> file you downloaded earlier.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Marquee select the three stars in the top row.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>With the three stars still selected, choose <u>P</u>ath &gt;
  <u>O</u>bject to path.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt =
  "Edit Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >).</p>
  <p>The selected stars are now shown as paths and nodes.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/StarPathsAndNodes.gif"
    alt = "The top stars are now paths and nodes."
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>The top 3 stars appearing as paths and nodes</figcaption>

    <img src = "images/DraggingPointToTheRight.gif"
    alt = "Dragging a single star point to the right"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  <p>Note how the selected node turns red, indicating that it is active. When
  you release the left mouse button and move the cursor off the node, it turns

  </li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; <u>U</u>ndo: Move nodes to undo your latest
  action of repositioning the star point.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the white background to deselect the stars.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Now click on the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
  alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >) and reselect the top three stars.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
  Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >). Note how the stars now show nodes at all
  inner and outer points.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Node tool, drag a marquee around the top points of the three
  selected stars.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/GroupSelectingWithEditPathsTool.gif"
    alt = "Group selecting with the Edit Paths tool" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Release the left mouse button. The selected points are now colored
  blue, indicating that they are now active.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/TopPointsSelected.gif"
    alt = "Top points of stars selected" class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Drag the top point of the right-most star to a new location. See how
  all the selected top points move in parallel with the one node you are
  moving.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/GroupMove.gif" alt = "Group moving nodes" class =
  "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  <p>Experiment by clicking (and &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking ) on different nodes
  and moving them around.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This grouping technique is handy when you need to move one or more parts of
one or more items the same distance in the same direction. You can also select
more than one node by &lt;Shift&gt;-clicking on the nodes with the Node tool.
When you use this technique,</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>select your items with the Select tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >),</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>choose <u>P</u>ath &gt; <u>O</u>bject to Path,</p></li>
    <li><p>click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
    Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >),</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>use the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit
    Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >) to select the nodes you want to
    manipulate, and</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>move the nodes as you need.</p></li>
  </ol>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the positioning, you can always choose <u>E</u>dit
&gt; <u>U</u>ndo: your latest action. A quick alternative to using the Edit
menu is to press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z, the shortcut key, to undo your last action.
(Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-z multiple times to undo multiple actions.)</p>

  <h2>Applying Selection Techniques</h2>
</header>
<p>In this next part of the tutorial, you will use some of the techniques
discussed as well as several others.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Download the art file
  <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/Doggie_pieces.svg"><b>Doggie_pieces.svg</b></a>
  to your computer.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Make sure that the entire canvas is visible by pressing the <b>4</b>
  key (the shortcut key for the <u>V</u>iew &gt; <u>Z</u>oom &gt;
  <u>D</u>rawing command). On the right you see the completed project, on the
  left are the objects needed to create the finished dog.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Doggie_pieces.gif" alt = "Pieces of a cartoon dog"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Start this lesson by hiding the Command bar, Tools Control bar,
  Toolbox, and color palette; you won&rsquo;t need them for this part of the
  tutorial. Hold down &lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Alt&gt;+p to hide the palette, or hide
  the Commands bar, Tools Control bar, Toolbox, and color palette individually
  using the <u>V</u>iew &gt; Sh<u>o</u>w/Hide submenu.</p>
  </li>

<li><p>Select the dog&rsquo;s head (light brown shape), choose <u>O</u>bject
  &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click the Lock checkbox to keep the head
  in position. Click outside the bounding box to unselect. You will not be
  able to select the dog&rsquo;s head until you choose <u>O</u>bject &gt;
  Unlock All. Leave it locked for now.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), select the brownish-red circle. To avoid
  grabbing a bounding box handle and resizing the circle, click and drag the
  center of the circle to slide it to its new location as the nose of the
      dog.  The circle may disappear behind the light brown face.  If so, while the circle
      is selected press <b>Page Up</b></p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p>Using the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
  "Selection tool" width = "26" >), drag both ears, the tuft of hair, and the
  mouth into position.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DoggieHalfwayThere.gif"
    alt = "Doggie cartoon halfway constructed"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Use the Select tool to move parts into place.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</li>
</ol>

<aside><p><b>Note</b>: The mouth contains two objects, so group,
    and move them together.  While selected, a <b>Page Up</b> may be needed to make the
    mouth visible. By shifting to the Outline mode, i.e.  <b>View --> Display Mode --> Outline</b>
    it is possible to see on the right face the circle nose overlaps the mouth slightly. When back in
    Normal mode, you may need to cycle through <b>Page Up</b> or <b>Page Down</b> to show the mouth between
  the face and nose. </p>
</aside>

<!-- <ol start = "6"> -->
  
<!-- </ol> -->

<p>Focusing on the hair tuft, use the solid arrow, or Select tool (<img src =
"images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >), to activate
the entire object and move it. Each object that you select is made up of several
anchor points. To activate these anchor points individually, switch to the Node
tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif" alt = "Edit paths by nodes tool" width =
"26" >).</p>

<ol start = "7" >
  <li><p>Click on the anchor point in the first peak, or tuft, of hair. When
  the individual point is selected, it appears as a solid red diamond (active),
  whereas the other anchor points are gray diamonds (inactive). When you move
  the Node tool off the active node, the node&rsquo;s color changes to blue,
  indicating that it&rsquo;s still selected but not currently active. Click and
      drag the individual anchor point to change its position. You may find that it jumps
    around quite a lot, if so zoom in to give finer positioning control.</p>

    alt = "Doggie hairs pulled individually"
    class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Moving individual anchor points.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</li>
  <li><p> The eye is made of several parts.  Further a grouped eye is stacked upon another
      eye made up of individual components. Choose the Select tool
      (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >) and
      pull the top, grouped, eye to the right to reveal the component eye beneath.
        
      <!-- Use
  either the marquee selection technique or the &lt;Shift&gt; key to select all
  three parts of the eye. Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>G</u>roup. Drag the eye
  into a position on the face to create a left eye. --> </p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Start to move the grouped eye, while still pressing the left mouse button (don&rsquo;t release it
  yet), press the space bar once. The eye is cloned as it is dragged to a
      new location. Position the eye on the right side of the face, a <b>Page Up</b> may be needed
          to bring the eye on top of the face.  
          Drag the cloned eye to the left eye and position it as the right eye.
          Release the mouse button. <b>Page Up</b> may be needed. The dog now has two eyes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<aside><p><b>Note</b>: If you hold down the &lt;Ctrl&gt; key when moving,
    the object is constrained to horizontal or vertical movements. Also, if you
    need to create a multitude of similar objects,
  you can first click on the original object to select it but do not release
  the mouse button. Drag the mouse along and tap on the space bar to create
  copies of the original object. You can adjust their position later.</p>

    make incremental saves as a small task is completed.  For example, place the red nose, and save.
    Place the mouth and save.  Place the ears and save, tuft and save. etc.  And if a mistake is made
    it is possible to Revert to the previous state.  This may save some steps when you try to back out of a

  <h2>Hiding Selections</h2>
</header>
<p>As you create more complicated artwork, existing objects may get in the way
and make it difficult to make selections. A good technique when designing in
Inkscape is to Hide selected artwork, which can be done by selecting an object
with the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
"Selection tool" width = "26" >), choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject
Properties, and clicking on the Hide checkbox in the Object Properties dialog.
A hidden object can not be moved or selected; it is essentially as though that
object no longer exists on the canvas. Bring all hidden objects back at the
same time by choosing <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All.</p>

  <h2>Advanced Selection Techniques</h2>
</header>
<p>When working on complex artwork, selections may become more difficult to
control. In this tutorial, we combine some of the tutorials already covered
with some additional features that will make selecting the correct items
easier.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Download file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial02/AlleenMaarDeBesteFriten.svg"><b>AlleenMaarDeBesteFriten.svg</b></a>
  to your computer. Have the Fill and Stroke dialog panel open.
      If it isn&rsquo;t visible, choose Window &gt; Fill and Stroke
    or Object --> Fill and Stroke.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/AlleenMaarDeFriten.gif" alt = "Just the French fries"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Note that the large words, <b>DE BESTE FRITEN</b>, cover and make it
  difficult to select items underneath. Using the Select tool (<img src =
  "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection tool" width = "26" >), select the
  words, <b>DE BESTE FRITEN</b>, choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject
  Properties, and click on the Hide checkbox in the Object Properties dialog.
      You may also see the yellow drop shadow text, if so hide this as well.
      The words will come back in the exact same location when we choose
  <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All at the end of the tutorial.</p>
  </li>
  <aside><p>If the text <b>DE BEST FRITEN</b> in the figure above looks
  different from what you see on your computer, the particular font used might
  not be installed. If you want to use this particular font, download it from
  this link, <a href = "Poetica_Chancery_I.ttf">Poetica Chancery</a> or from
  this Web site at <a href = "https://best-font.com/fonts/download-poetica-chancery-i-font.html">Best-Font.com</a>.
  This Web site is one of many that have Poetica Chancery available for
  download. Install the font on your computer, exit from Inkscape and then
  restart it, so Inkscape can see and use it.</p>
  <p>Poetica Chancery is an elegant decorative font used to enhance the
  attractiveness of many a graphical piece of artwork. You might find ample
  opportunity to use it as you develop your typographical skills and sense and
  sensibility of using typographical design.</p>
  </aside>
  <li><p>Changing the fill of all the yellow stars to white individually could be
  time-consuming, but using the <b>Edit Same</b> feature reduces the trouble.
  Select any one yellow star and then choose <u>E</u>dit &gt; Select
  Sa<u>m</u>e &gt; Fill. All the other stars become selected.
  Make sure that the fill box is forward in the toolbar (or the Fill tab highlighted) 
  and select white from
  the Color palette at the bottom of the screen. The stars all change to
  white.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/WhiteStars.gif" alt = "Yellow stars changed to white"
    class = "img-fluid">
  </figure>
  </li>
  <li><p>Select one of the shapes creating the French fries and then choose
  <u>E</u>dit &gt; Select Sa<u>m</u>e &gt; <u>S</u>troke Color. The french fry
  shape as well as the carton, has a black-colored stroke so all strokes that are black are now
  activated. Using the <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>F</u>ill and Stroke&hellip; >
  Stroke style palette (or tab,) type <b>5</b> into the <u>W</u>idth textbox to increase
  the line weight to 5 pt (make sure the units of measurement are points before changing the
  number, or you will have to change it a second time) and
  press &lt;Enter&gt; to set the value.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Click in an empty area to deselect the artwork.</p></li>
  <li><p>Choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All to bring back the words <b>DE
  BESTE FRITEN</b>.</p>

  <h2>Exploring on Your Own</h2>
</header>
<p>Experiment with shapes by creating a shape object, circle, star, rectangle,
or whatever you like. Clone it several times. Apply different colors and
strokes to the shapes and reselect them using the <b>Select Sa<u>m</u>e</b>
menu item. Try cloning multiple items at the same time.</p>

  <h2>Review Answers</h2>
</header>

<ol>
  <li><p>Items that have no fill must be selected by clicking on their stroke
  (border).  Think, an object that has no fill, has it's fill hidden, and if it
  is hidden, it cannot be selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Using the Edit paths by nodes tool (<img src = "images/NodeTool.gif"
  alt = "Edit Path by Nodes tool" width = "26" >), you can select one or more
  individual anchor points and make changes to the shape of an object.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>If something is blocking your access to a selection, you can choose
  <u>O</u>bject &gt; <u>O</u>bject Properties, and click on the Hide checkbox
  in the Object Properties dialog. The object is not deleted, just hidden in
  the same position until you choose <u>O</u>bject &gt; Unhide All.</p>
  </li>
