			<h1>From the Top</h1>
<p>Inkscape is a professional-quality vector-graphics software program
which runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Design professionals and hobbyists
worldwide use it to create a mind-boggling variety of graphics, including
illustrations, icons, logos, diagrams, maps, and web graphics. It uses
W3C open standard SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its native format, and,
very importantly, it is free and open-source software.</p>

<h2>About This Tutorial</h2>

<p>The wheel has been invented a long time ago.  However, whenever a new model
of bicycle or car is designed, a new model of tire might have to be created
along with it to ensure driving ease and comfort.  This series of tutorials can
be considered as a new tire for a new design of computer illustration program.
Its underlying principle is that you learn by doing, so the approach is
hands-on. Lessons are step-by-step. You learn at your own pace.</p>

<p>Inkscape 1.0.1 has been around since 6 September 2020. Features have been
improved, bugs have been fixed, and the future holds great promise for a wealth
of innovations. I salute and praise the Inkscape community, all volunteers, who
give of their time, thought, imagination, and care to provide the world with a
tool that helps to fuel an artist&rsquo;s passion to create.</p>

<p>Each chapter contains a project for you to explore. As you work on each
aspect of the project, you learn new concepts and techniques. You are also
invited to explore further, experiment, and just play with what you&rsquo;re
learning.</p>

<p>Images created for this tutorial were created using Inkscape 1.0.1 and
Irfanview 4.56 on a Windows 10-based PC. The Web pages are made responsive
using Bootstrap 4.5.2.</p>

<h2>What You Need to Know Before You Start</h2>
<p>You need to be comfortable with your computer and its operating system.
Know how to work with the keyboard, mouse, menus, and commands. Also, be
familiar with opening, saving, and closing files. Review any printed or online
Windows documentation if necessary.</p>
