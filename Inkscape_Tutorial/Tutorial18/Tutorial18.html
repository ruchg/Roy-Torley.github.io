      Patterns feature allows you to fill an empty space with different
      geometric shapes, such as straight, curved, and zig-zag lines. With line
      patterns, you can make your artwork look like a piece of intaglio printing
      or engraving. You can combine line patterns with background images,
      incorporate gradients and blurs, and mask imported bitmap images that
      produces a composite picture of multi-dimensional breadth and depth to
      capture the viewer&rsquo;s attention.</p>

  <p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll learn how to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create line grids using the Patterns feature to simulate engraving.
    </li>
    <li>Blur edges of bitmap images using masking to produce vignettes.
    </li>
    <li>Embed bitmap images into a host Inkscape file.
    </li>
    <li>Create a background cloud image using a gradient and blurred brush
    strokes.

    <h2>Combining Artwork</h2>
  </header>
  <p>In the previous tutorial (Tutorial 17), you combined Inkscape artwork with
  images from other graphics, producing a mult-faceted composite image for a
  poster. In this tutorial, you&rsquo;ll continue combining continuous-tone
  photographs with vector-based line art. </p>
  <p>You will open an Inkscape file that contains a bitmap image of a mountain
  (Mt. Hood in the state of Oregon, USA) with a map overlay that defines areas
  of lightness and darkness. You will separate and fill each individual area
  with a different line pattern to simulate horizontal line engraving of light
  and dark areas. In another Inkscape file, you will import bitmap images of
  rare Oregon orchid flowers brought in from the Internet and create vignettes
  out of them. Finally, you will create a background image of a lightly clouded
  sky with a linear gradient and a few blurred brush strokes to imitate
  separate, distant individual clouds. You will combine all of these images
  into one to create a composite poster image.</p>

      <h4>Intaglio Printing</h4>
      <p><i>Intaglio</i> is the family of printing and printmaking techniques
      where an image is acid-etched or mechanically cut into a surface, usually
      of metal, such as copper or zinc. The lines, curves, and other cuts hold
      ink which is then transferred onto a page. When a sharp cutting
      instrument, like a <i>burin</i> (a strong steel needle meant for digging
      grooves and pits into a metal plate) is used to create the image
      prototype, this particular method of creating an image is called
      <i>engraving</i>. An example of line engraving technique in action and a
      finished piece of artwork are shown on the right.</p>

    <h2>Separating Areas of Different Shading</h2>
    <p>At first glance, Mt. Hood is a mesh (and a mess) of overlapping pieces of
    slope. Each piece will contain its own color of engraving. You will
    group-select the central portion of the mountain that contains the map, make
    a duplicate of the map and move it down from the image. You will then make a
    duplicate of that map and disassemble it into its various parts for
    individual treatment.</p>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>With the Select Tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif"
    alt = "Selection tool icon" width = "26">), draw a rectangle around the
    mapped area to group-select all the map pieces. Make sure all pieces are
    within the rectangle. (For review on group-selecting, see Tutorial 2,
    Using the Select Tool.)</p>

    <h2>Creating a Pattern Palette for the Engraving Effect</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Engraving colors into a piece of artwork can be a delicate and tricky
  endeavor. Engraving color fills are alternate colored and white lines and
  curves, resulting from the transfer of the ink in the line and curve grooves
  dug into the metal engraving plate interlayered with white lines from the
  raised areas between the grooves. You see an average color when you stand back
  from the work, and alternating colored and white lines when you look more
  closely, as shown below.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Nemo.png" alt = "An engraving by Alphonse de Neuville
    from Jules Verne's 2000 Leagues Under the Sea" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>An engraving by Alphonse de Neuville from Jules Verne's 2000
    Leagues Under the Sea.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>A technique that helps in keeping engraved fills equivalent in lightness
  (or darkness) to an original color involves making the starting color for the
  colored lines darker than the original. Neighboring white lines can create
  an average brightness that mimics the original color to satisfaction. It can
  take a certain amount of experimentation to get the color balance just right.
  In this tutorial, you will be provided reasonable starting colors to create
  your engraving palette.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The figure below shows a palette of six colors to the right of the
    artwork. The bottommost color will be used as a solid fill for the
    bottommost area of hill topography at the base of Mt. Hood. All other
    colors will serve as the base color for an engraving grid. Each rectangle of
    color has its corresponding hexadecimal code, or hex code, for short, above
    it. The final <b>ff</b> on each code stands for its opacity, which is 100%
    in each instance.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/SelectingPaletteColors.png" alt = "Selecting palette
      colors" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Selecting palette colors.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Note how the colors become light as you go from bottom to top. They
    are to represent areas of distance and shadow, in keeping with how mountains
    can appear lighter and bluer as they recede into the distance.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will now create the engraving grid from the dark blue rectangle
    second from the bottom.</p>
    <p>Select and duplicate the dark blue rectangle with &lt;Ctrl&gt;-D, and
    move the duplicate off to the side.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MovingDarkBlue.gif" alt = "Moving the duplicate dark

        <figcaption>Moving the duplicate dark blue rectangle.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Make a second duplicate rectangle and move it down to below the first
    duplicate.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Activate the Snap Tools toolbar if it isn&rsquo;t active already, and
    click on the <b>Enable snapping (%)</b> (<img src =
    "images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt = "Enable snapping icon" width = "26">),
    <b>Snap bounding boxes</b> (<img src = "images/SnapBoundingBoxesIcon.gif"

    box corners</b> (<img src = "images/SnapBoundingBoxCornersIcon.gif" alt =
    "Snap bounding box corners icon" width = "26">) icons.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the snap tools activated, position the lower dark blue duplicate
    rectangle so that it is exactly in line with the upper duplicate. It will
    snap into place.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Object &gt; Pattern &gt; Objects to Pattern to convert the
    grouped rectangular object into a pattern template.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Click on the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Node tool icon" width = "26">) in the toolbox</p>
    <p>Note there there is an &times; in the upper left square handle of the
    rectangle. This &times; is the reference point or origin for the Pattern
    tool, much like the <b>0</b> on a number line.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ActivateNodeTool.gif" alt = "Activating the Node

      </figure>
    </li>
    <li>With the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node
    tool icon" width = "26">) still active, click-drag the &times; up a little
    bit from its original location. A circle and square handle move up along
    with the &times.</p>
    <p>The circular handle, which you won't use, governs the angle
    at which the lines (or any other pattern figure) are oriented. You'll keep
    the lines horizontal.</p>
    <p>The square handle, however, governs how thick or thin the grid lines are.
    You can move the square up or down, and the two rectangles that make up the
    pattern template grow either thicker or thinner, depending upon which
    direction you move the square. If there were vertical lines, moving the
    square left or right would change their thickness. In this case, there are
    no vertical lines, so we don&rsquo;t need to be concerned about them.</p>

        tool up" class = "img-width">
        <figcaption>Moving the Pattern tool up.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Hover the Node tool (<img src = "images/NodeToolIcon.gif" alt = "Node
    tool icon" width = "26">) over the square handle. It turns red to show that
    it is active and ready for manipulation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/HoverOverSquare.gif" alt = "Hovering over the Pattern
        tool square" class = "img-width">
        <figcaption>Hovering over the Pattern tool square.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Keeping the Node tool on the square handle (it should stay red so
    long as you hover over it), drag it up toward the Patter tool reference
    handle.</p>
    <p>Two things happen as the square approaches the &times. First of all,
    the two rectangles become thinner and more appear in the space that
    originally contained two. Also, the circular handle approaches the reference
    handle, moving along a horizontal line. This is what you want in making
    your engraving grids.</p>
    <p>Stop a short distance away from the reference point, and move the red
    square up toward the circle. The grid lines continue to become thinner. Stop
    when you feel a reasonable thinness has been reached.</p>
    <p>By keeping the Pattern tool reference handle, square grid thickness
    handle, and the circular grid orientation handle is close proximity, you can
    keep close tabs (pun intentional) on what you doing with the tool.</p>

    <h2>Creating the Engraving Effect</h2>
    <p>You have now created an engraving palette. Your next step is to put it to
    good use. In this section, you will use Inkscape&rsquo;s Clip tool to turn
    each area into an engraving.</p>

    <li><p>Determine which shapes should have lighter or darker grids and
    organize them by shade category. Below, shapes are categorized from lightest
    shading at the top row to the solid blue at the bottom. Their associated

    <h2>Assembling the Pieces of Engraving Work</h2>
  </header>
  <p>If you enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzles, then you will love this
  section. Here, you will take all the pieces of Mt. Hood that you drew and fit
  them together much as you would a jigsaw puzzle. The difference is that you
  will also determine where each piece is situated in the image stack. Some
  pieces need to be partially situated underneath other pieces in the image
  stack to give the impression of depth or of one part of the mountain casting a
  shadow on another. It will be as if you were working with a three-dimensional
  puzzle!</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>A good first step is to take the largest piece of the mountain and
    make it the background upon which all the other pieces will lie.</p>
    <p>Make the Snap Tool toolbar active and click on the <b>Enable snapping
    (%)</b> (<img src = "images/EnableSnappingIcon.gif" alt = "Enable snapping
    icon" width = "26">), <b>Snap bounding boxes</b> (<img src =
    "images/SnapBoundingBoxesIcon.gif" alt = "Snap bounding boxes icon" width =
    "26">), and <b>Snap bounding box corners</b> (<img src =
    "images/SnapBoundingBoxCornersIcon.gif" alt = "Snap bounding box corners
    icon" width = "26">) icons.</p>
    <p>Move or copy the piece that contains the summit (the biggest piece) and
    move it so that it fits exactly inside the black outline that has the same
    shape. A tooltip box will inform you when positioning is exact.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Jigsaw01.gif" alt = "Positioning the first and
        largest piece of the mountain puzzle on the figure" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Positioning the first and largest piece of the mountain
        puzzle on the figure.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will now position the piece in a good place in the image stack.</p>
    <p>With the puzzle piece still selected, click on the <b>Raise selection to
    top</b> icon (<img src = "images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt = "Raise
    selection to top icon" width = "26">) to put the piece at the top of the
    image stack.</p>
    <p>Press the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower selection one step icon"
    width = "26">) several times. As you press the <b>Lower selection one
    step</b> icon, the black border of a different puzzle piece will appear as
    the selected piece is put underneath it in the image stack.</p>
    <p>When the puzzle piece disappears, you have put it underneath the original
    background picture. You know where the piece is and now it&rsquo;s time to
    raise it one step in the image stack.</p>
    <p>Press the <b>Raise selection one step</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt = "Raise selection one step icon"
    width = "26">) to raise the puzzle piece to lie directly upon the background
    picture and underneath all the black borders for the other pieces. This is
    how you can work with the third dimension of this three-dimensional jigsaw
    puzzle.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Jigsaw02.gif" alt = "Positioning the first and
        largest piece of the mountain puzzle in the image stack" class =

        puzzle in the image stack.</figcaption>

    </li>
    <li><p>Move the second largest puzzle piece into its place on the figure
    where you see its black outline. The Snap function will inform you when
    positioning is exact.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Jigsaw03.gif" alt = "Positioning the second largest

        on the figure.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>With the second piece still selected, bring it to the top of the
    image stack by pressing the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt = "Raise selection to top icon"
    width = "26">), and then pressing the <b>Lower selection one step</b> icon
    (<img src = "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower selection
    one step icon" width = "26">) until it disappears underneath the first piece
    you have put in.</p>
    <p>Press the <b>Raise selection one step</b> icon (<img src =
    "images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt = "Raise selection one step icon"
    width = "26">) to bring the puzzle piece up one level so that it sits ontop
    of the first puzzle piece. You should see the black borders for other pieces
    that will lie ontop of what you just inserted. These other pieces, once
    included, will represent a hill, a cliff on the mountain, and their shadows,
    giving your artwork a sense of depth. The piece you just moved is lighter
    compared to the underlying piece because it represents a portion of slope
    whose snow is reflecting more sunlight than the background.</p>

    </li>
    <li><p>The next piece is a hill that stands in front and to our right of
    Mt. Hood. Move this next, slightly darker puzzle piece into its place on the
    figure where you see its black outline. The Snap function will let you know
    when it&rsquo;s in position.</p>

    image stack by pressing the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon (<img src =

    (<img src = "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower selection
    one step icon" width = "26">) until it disappears underneath the second,
    very light piece you have put already in. Then, press the <b>Raise selection
    one step</b> icon (<img src = "images/Raise1StepIcon.gif" alt = "Raise
    selection one step icon" width = "26">) so that it sits ontop of the second
    puzzle piece.</p>
    Note that the bottom of the hill piece is just a straight line. That part
    will be hidden by another, overlying piece that will represent closer hill
    country.</p>

    <li><p>You will now give the hill you just inserted a shadow.</p>
    <p>Move the next, even darker puzzle piece that looks like a triangle into
    place where you see its corresponding black outline. The Snap function, of
    course, will let you know when it&rsquo;s in position.</p>

    (<img src = "images/LowerSelectionOneStepIcon.gif" alt = "Lower selection
    one step icon" width = "26">) until it is partially covered by the hill
    piece. You don&rsquo;t have to lower it any further in the image stack
    because it just needs to be behind the hill, representing its shadow on the
    main mountain slope in back of it, and heightening the suggestion of
    three-dimensionality. You will attend to the black border curves and lines
    later.</p>

        <img src = "images/Jigsaw08.gif" alt = "Putting the hill shadow piece

    <li><p>Just as you did in Step 7, move the even darker puzzle piece of front
    hill country, seen in the figure below, into position in the black border
    having the same shape. This piece of the puzzle represents even closer hill
    country with less snow and more forest, seen at a distance.</p>
    <p>Make sure that this piece is at the top of the image stack by clicking on
    the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon (<img src =

    the ridge defined by the right-hand puzzle piece. If you don&rsquo;t see
    the shadow, then you might have lowered it too far and it is now underneath
    the main slope of the mountain. Press the <b>Raise selection to top</b> icon
    (<img src = "images/RaiseSelection2TopIcon.gif" alt = "Raise selection to

    <h2>Using the Masking Function to Create Vignettes</h2>
  </header>
  <p>A vignette is a picture whose sides are blurred to where they fade into
  the color of their background. In this section, you will create two vignettes
  of rare Oregon orchids for placement on each side of Mt. Hood.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download Inkscape file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial18/Orchids.svg"><b>Orchids.svg</b></a>
    and store it in a convenient location.</p>
    <p>Choose File &gt; Open, navigate to where <b>Orchids.svg</b> is located
    and open it. The file contains two bitmap images of orchid flower.</p>
    <p>You&rsquo;ll start this section by working with the top picture of the
    Calypso orchids (see the figure below).</p>

    <li><p>With the Rectangle Tool (<img src = "images/RectangleTool.gif"
    alt = "Rectangle Tool icon" width = "26">), draw a rectangle over the
    picture of the orchids. Give it a stroke thickness of 20 pixels and no
    color fill.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>With the file <b>Orchids.svg</b> still open, &lt;Shift&gt;-click on
    the two vignettes to group-select them.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Edit &gt; Copy to copy them to your computer&rsquo;s
    Clipboard.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>If the <b>Tutorial18_start.svg</b> file isn&rsquo;t open, then File
    &gt; Open, navigate to the file and open it.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Edit &gt; Paste to paste the two vignettes onto the artwork
    of Mt. Hood.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move the vignettes so that they are placed in the upper corners of
    the poster rectangle. Now you can start doing precision positioning.</p>

    <li><p>So far, there are only images in this poster. It is time to put in
    text.</p>
    <p>A font that has some of the same line characteristics as the Mt.
    Hood artwork would be good at maintaining the theme of line art. We choose
    <b>Relief Serif</b>. If this font is not on your computer, you can download
    it for free at
    <a href = "https://freefontsdownload.net/free-reliefserif-font-104101.htm">
    <b>FreeFontsDownload.net</b></a>,

    There are other font sites on the Internet, too.</p>
    <p>Click on the Text tool icon (<img src = "images/TextToolIcon.gif" alt =
    "Text Tool icon" width = "26">) in the toolbox. Then click somewhere between
    the two vignettes and type on three lines <i>Oregon, Sentinel Mountains,
    Orchids of Mystery</i>. Your text might look different from that in the
    figure below, especially in font size. That is not a problem.</p>

  <p>You have just finished Tutorial 18 and learned how to create the
  appearance of engraving, old-style pictures or vignettes, and how to
  complement the appearance of engraved images and engraving-style fonts.</p>

    <h2>Exploring Further</h2>
  </header>
    <p>This tutorial shows you only one way of many of using patterns, creating
    an engraving effect, and creating the vignette look. Experiment with
    creating engraving images where colored lines alternate with lines of other
    colors. Engraving lines don&rsquo;t have to be all horizontal. They can be
    at any angle, curved, bent (using the Live Path Effect Bend function),
    and made into hatched images where lines and curves cross. Find pictures on
    the Internet whose borders can be blurred a lot, as seen in many portraits
    from the 1800s and early 1900s, and give your imagination full reign.</p>
