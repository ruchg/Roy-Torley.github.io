    <h2>Printing: An Overview</h2>
  </header>
  <p>When you print a document from a computer, data is sent from the document
  to the printing device, either to be printed on paper or to be converted to a
  positive or negative image on film. For black-and-white, grayscale, or low
  quantities of color artwork, many people use desktop printers. However, if you
  require large quantities of printed images, such as a brochure or magazine ad,
  you&rsquo;ll need to prepare your artwork for output on a commercial printing
  press. Printing on a commercial press is an art that requires time and
  experience to perfect. In addition to close communication with a printing
  professional, learning basic printing concepts and terminology will help you
  produce printed results that meet your expectations.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> This lesson assumes that you have a desktop printer for use
  with the exercises. If you don&rsquo;t have a desktop printer available, read
  the sections and skip the step-by-step instructions.</p>
  <p>Different printing requirements require different printing processes. To
  determine your printing requirements, consider the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What effect do you want the printed piece to have on your audience?
    </li>
    <li>Will your artwork be printed in black and white? Color?
    </li>
    <li>Does it require special paper?
    </li>
    <li>How many printed copies do you need?
    </li>
    <li>If you&rsquo;re printing in color, is precise color matching necessary,
    or will approximate color matching suffice?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Take a minute to consider several types of print jobs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>A black-and-white interoffice newsletter</b>, requiring a low
    quantity of printed copies. For this type of printing job, you can generally
    use a 300-600 dpi (dots per inch) desktop laser printer to output the
    original, and then use a copy machine to reproduce the larger quantity.
    </li>
    <li><b>A business card using black and one other color.</b> The term
    two-color printing typically refers to printing with black and one other
    color, although it may also refer to printing with two colors that are not
    black. Two-color printing is less expensive than four-color printing and
    lets you select exact color matches, called spot colors, which can be
    important for logos. For precise color matching, two-color printing is done
    on a printing press; if only an approximate color match is required, you
    might use a desktop color printer.
    </li>
    <li><b>A party invitation using two colors and tints of those colors.</b> In
    addition to printing two solid colors, you can print tints of the colors to
    add depth to your printed artwork. Two-color printing is often done on
    colored paper that compliments the ink colors and might be done on a desktop
    color printer or on a printing press, depending on the desired quantity and
    the degree of color matching required.
    </li>
    <li><b>A newspaper.</b> Newspapers are typically printed on a printing press
    because they are time-sensitive publications printed in large quantities. In
    addition, newspapers are generally printed on large rolls of newsprint,
    which are then trimmed and folded to the correct size.
    </li>
    <li><b>A fashion magazine or catalog requiring accurate color
    reproduction.</b> Four-color printing refers to mixing the four process
    ink colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, or CMYK) for printed output.
    When accurate color reproduction is required, printing is done on a printing
    press using CMYK inks. CMYK inks can reproduce a good amount of the visible
    color spectrum, with the exception of neon or metallic colors. You&rsquo;ll
    learn more about color models in the next section.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>About Printing Devices</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Now that you&rsquo;ve looked at several types of publications and different
  ways to reproduce them, you&rsquo;ll begin learning basic printing concepts
  and printing terminology.</p>
  <header>
    <h3>Halftone Screens</h3>
  </header>
  <p>To reproduce any type of artwork, a printing device typically breaks down
  the artwork into a series of dots of various sizes called a halftone screen.
  Black dots are used to print black-and-white or grayscale artwork. For color
  artwork, a halftone screen is created for each ink color (cyan, magenta,
  yellow, and black); these then overlay one another at different angles to
  produce the full range of printed color. To see a good example of how
  individual halftone screens overlay each other at different angles on a
  printed page, look at a color comics page through a magnifying glass.</p>
  <p>The size of the dots in a halftone screen determines how light or dark
  colors appear in print. The smaller the dot, the lighter the color appears;
  the larger the dot, the darker the color appears.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Halftone_Screen.png" alt = "Enlarged detail showing dots
    in a halftone screen" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Enlarged detail showing dots in a halftone screen.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <section>
  <a href = "#Top"><img src = "images/BackToTop.png" alt = "Back to Top link"
  class = "img-fluid"></a>
  <header>
    <h3>Screen Frequency</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Screen frequency (also called line screen ruling, or halftone frequency)
  refers to the number of rows or lines of dots used to render an image on film
  or paper. In addition, the rows of dots are broken down into individual
  squares, called halftone cells. Screen frequency is measured in lines per inch
  (<b>lpi</b>) and is a fixed value you can set for your printing device.</p>
  <p>As a general rule, higher screen frequencies produce finer detail in
  printed output. This is because the higher the screen frequency, the smaller
  the halftone cells, and subsequently, the smaller the halftone dot in the
  cell.</p>
  <p>However, a high screen frequency alone does not guarantee high-quality
  output. The screen frequency must be appropriate to the paper, the inks, and
  the printer or printing press used to output the artwork. Your printing
  professional will help you select the appropriate screen value for your
  artwork and output device.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/image-asset.jpeg" alt = "Pictures of the Mona Lisa
      shown at different screen frequencies" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Pictures of the Mona Lisa shown at different screen
      frequencies.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>
  <section>
  <header>
    <h3>Output Device Resolution</h3>
  </header>
  <p>The resolution of a printing device describes the number of dots the
  printing device has available to render, or create, a halftone dot. The higher
  the output device resolution, the higher the quality of the printed output.
  For example, the printed quality of an image output at 2400 dots per inch
  (<b>dpi</b>) is higher than the printed quality of an image output at 300 dpi.
  Inkscape is resolution-independent and will always print at the printing
  device&rsquo;s highest resolution capability.</p>
  <p>The quality of printed output depends on the relationship between the
  resolution of the output device (<b>dpi</b>) and the screen frequency
  (<b>lpi</b>). As a general rule, high-resolution output devices use higher
  screen frequency values to produce the highest quality images. For example,
  an imagesetter with a resolution of 2400 dpi and a screen frequency of 177 lpi
  produces a higher quality image than a desktop printer with a resolution of
  300 to 600 dpi and a screen frequency of 85 lpi.</p>
  <p>Color is produced by a computer monitor and printing device using two
  different color models (methods for displaying and measuring color). The human
  eye perceives color according to the wavelength of the light it receives.
  Light containing the full color spectrum is perceived as white; in the absence
  of light, the eye perceives black.</p>
  <p>The <i>gamut</i> of a color model is the range of colors that can be
  displayed or printed. The largest color gamut is that viewed in nature; all
  other color gamuts produce a subset of nature&rsquo;s color gamut. The two
  most common color models are red, green, and blue (<b>RGB</b>), the method
  by which monitors display color; and cyan, magenta, yellow, and black
  (<b>CMYK</b>), the method by which images are printed using four process ink
  colors.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <header>
    <h3>The RGB Color Model</h3>
  </header>
  <p>A large percentage of the visible spectrum of color can be represented by
  mixing three basic components of colored light in various proportions. These
  components are known as the <b>additive colors</b>: red, green and blue
  (<b>RGB</b>). The RGB color model is called the <b>additive color model</b>
  because various percentages of each colored light are added to create color.
  All monitors display color using the <b>RGB</b> color model.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <header>
    <h3>The CMYK Color Model</h3>
  </header>
  <p>If 100% of red, green, or blue is subtracted from white light, the
  resulting color is cyan, magenta, or yellow, respectively. For example, if an
  object absorbs (subtracts) 100% red light and reflects green and blue, cyan is
  the perceived color. Cyan, magenta, and yellow are called the <b>subtractive
  primaries</b>, and they form the basis for printed colors. In addition to
  cyan, magenta, and yellow, black ink is used to generate true black and to
  deepen the shadows in images. These four inks (<b>CMYK</b>) are often called
  <i>process colors</i> because they are the four standard inks used in the
  printing process.</p>

    mixing models" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Additive and subtractive color mixing models. The numbers are
    <b>rgb</b> color codes.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>
<section>
  <header>
    <h3>Spot Colors</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Whereas process colors are reproduced using cyan, magenta, yellow, and
  black inks, <i>spot colors</i> are premixed inks used in place of, or in
  addition to, CMYK colors. Spot colors can be selected from color-matching
  systems, such as the <b>PANTONE&reg;</b> or <b>TOYO&trade;</b> color
  libraries. Many spot colors can be converted to their process color
  equivalents when printed; however, some spot colors, such as metallic or
  iridescent colors, require their own plate on press.</p>
  <p>Use spot colors in the following situations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To save money on one-color and two-color print jobs. (When your printing
    budget won&rsquo;t allow for four-color printing, you can still print
    relatively inexpensively using one or two colors.)
    </li>
    <li>To print logos or other graphic elements that require precise color
    matching. You want the printer in San Francisco to use the same color of red
    as the printer in Seattle.
    </li>
    <li>To print special inks, such as metallic, fluorescent, or pearlescent
    colors.

    <h2>Color Management</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Although all color gamuts overlap, they don&rsquo;t match exactly, which is
  why some colors on your monitor can&rsquo;t be reproduced in print. The colors
  that can&rsquo;t be reproduced in print are called <i>out-of-gamut</i> colors
  because they are outside the spectrum of printable colors.</p>
  <p>You might want or need to print your artwork on a special type of paper.
  Paper types include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>repro paper</i> (offset or printing paper)</li>
    <li><i>coated paper</i> (couch&eacute; paper)</li>
    <li><i>tissue paper</i></li>
    <li><i>newsprint paper</i></li>
    <li><i>cardboard</i></li>
    <li><i>Kraft paper</i></li>
    <li><i>paperboard</i>, and</li>
    <li><i>fine arts paper types</i>, such as cold-press water-color paper,
    Hahnem&uuml;hle German etching paper, luster photo paper, fiber papers,
    and many more among the plethora of species and subspecies of printing sheet
    media.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You might see a completely different set and range of colors
  on the printed sheet in comparison to what you see on your computer
  screen.</p>
  <p>To compensate for these differences and to ensure the closest match between
  on-screen colors and printed colors, Inkscape includes a color management
  system (CMS) that lets you select profiles for your monitor and for the output
  device to which you&rsquo;ll print. Selecting a color profile controls the
  conversion of RGB values to CMYK values at print time. To select a color
  profile, you use Inkscape&rsquo;s color management system.</p>
  <p>The point of color management is not to help you achieve better colors in
  print, but to help keep in check expectations as to how the artwork will
  print. Color management, essentially, makes your RGB monitor represent colors
  as they appear when printed in CMYK.</p>
  <ol>

    <li><p>In the <b>Display adjustment</b> section, click on the down-arrow in
    the current <b>Display profile</b> selection field. Inkscape comes with two
    settings already installed: <b>&lt;none&gt;</b> and

      </figure>
    </li>
    <aside><p>The <b>sRGB61966-2.1</b> setting option comes from the North
    America General Purpose 2 display color setting. It provides all-purpose
    general color settings for images on-screen, in print, and on the Web. It is
    widely used in North America. (The <b>sRGB</b> stands for <b>s</b>tandard
    <b>R</b>ed <b>G</b>reen <b>B</b>lue.) <b>sRGB</b> is often the
    &ldquo;default&rdquo; color space for images that contain no color space
    information.</p>

    <h3>Printing Black-and-White Proofs</h3>
  </header>
  <p>As a general rule, you should print black-and-white proofs of all your
  documents at different stages of your work to check the layout and to verify
  the accuracy of text and graphics before preparing the document for final
  output.</p>

    <h3>Soft-proofing Colors</h3>
  </header>
  <p>In a color-managed work flow, you can use the precision of color profiles
  to soft-proof your document directly on the monitor. Soft-proofing lets you
  preview on-screen how your document&rsquo;s colors will look when reproduced
  on a particular output device.</p>
  <p>The reliability of soft-proofing completely depends, however, on the
  quality of your monitor, your monitor profile, and the ambient lighting
  conditions of your workstation area. In other words, if you are working in an
  inconsistent environment, with varying light throughout the day, you might not
  get reliable results.</p>
  <p>Inkscape currently has only one device profile as a proof setting:
  <b>Agfa: Swop standard</b>. Swop stands for <b>S</b>pecifications for
  <b>W</b>eb <b>O</b>ffset <b>P</b>ublications, which is both a company and
  name of a set of specifications whose goal is to make data for printing
  consistent, reliable, and of high quality across different printing and
  viewing devices.</p>
  <p>For this tutorial, you will download and install a device profile developed
  by the European Color Initiative (ECI), an organization whose goal is to develop and
  enhance device-independent processing of color data in digital publication
  systems.</p>
  <p>Click on <a href = "https://www.athesiadruck.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Files/Downloads/PSO_Uncoated_ISO12647_eci.icc"><b>https://www.athesiadruck.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Files/Downloads/PSO_Uncoated_ISO12647_eci.icc</b></a>
  to download this device profile.</p>
  <p>Right-click on the downloaded file and select <b>Install</b> in the
  short-cut menu. (It&rsquo;s just like installing a font, but this time
  it&rsquo;s a color profile.)</p>
  <p>Exit Inkscape and then restart it so that Inkscape will &ldquo;see&rdquo;
  the new profile and add it to its list of device profiles.</p>
  <ol start = "3">
    <li><p><b>In the Color management</b> dialog box, click on the down arrow in
    the <b>Device profile</b> selection box.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Use the <b>Device profile</b> menu to select <b>PSO Uncoated ISO
    12647 (ECI)</b>, which you just downloaded and installed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose <b>View</b> and check the <b>Color-Managed View</b>
    checkbox to create a color preview. The image automatically shifts colors to
    display what it would look like were it printed according to the PSO

    <h3>Creating Color Separations</h3>
  </header>
  <p>To print color artwork on a printing press, you must first separate the
  composite art into its component colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, and
  any spot colors, if applicable. The process of breaking down composite artwork
  into its component colors is called <i>color separation</i>.</p>
  <p>Inkscape currently does not have the capability of producing color
  separations of artwork. However, we have the opportunity here to create CMYK
  separations using a separate external program called <b>Scribus</b>.</p>
  <p><b>Scribus</b> has many of the graphic manipulation features that Inkscape
  has. However, its focus is on preparing artwork for printing, either on a
  desktop printer or on a printing press. Excepting the section on <b>Working
  with Two-Color Illustrations</b>, the remainder of this tutorial focuses
  on using Scribus as a means of producing CMYK color separations and
  registration marks that help guide a professional printer in printing and
  cutting sheets to your specifications. I will remind you from time to time
  that you should consult your professional printer if you have any questions,
  uncertainties, or problems with document preparation. They are professionals
  at what they do &mdash; they know their job.</p>

  <h4>Installing Scribus</h4>
  <p>Complete installation of Scribus is a two-step process.
  <ol>
    <li>You will download and install both Scribus and a helper program,
    <b>Ghostscript</b>.</p>
    <p>The current version of Scribus is <b>Scribus 1.5.7</b>. You can download
      it from <a href = "https://www.scribus.net/downloads/"><b>https://www.scribus.net/downloads/</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Read through which version of Scribus is best for you, download it, and
      install it keeping all default values.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download and install the latest version of <b>Ghostscript</b>
  (Ghostscript 9.55.0) that&rsquo;s appropriate for your computer from
  <a href = "https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html"><b>https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html</b></a>. Keep
  all default values during installation.</p>
  <p>The Ghostscript executable files are located at
  C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.55.0\bin on my computer. The <i>bin</i> subdirectory
  contains two versions of Ghostwriter: <b>gswin64.exe</b>, which is written in
  Postscript, and <b>gswin64c.exe</b>, which is brand new and is "written from
  the ground up" in the C programming language (hence the &ldquo;c&rdquo; in the
  gswin64c.exe). Remember where <b>gswin64c.exe</b> is located so you can show
  Scribus where it is when you configure it.</p>
  <p>Ghostscript is undergoing serious upgrading to conform better with advances
  in modern graphics capabilities. The C version allows manipulation of
  transparency, along with other graphics tools, which the Postscript version
  cannot. Ghostscript is important in allowing Scribus to import plain-vanilla
  and enhanced postscript files (.ps and .eps files). You will import Inkscape
  files that have been converted into .ps or .eps files into Scribus.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Configuring Scribus</h5>
  <p>For this tutorial, the only things you need to do are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Start Scribus.</p></li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Preferences.</p></li>
    <li><p>Click on <b>External Tools</b>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enter the location of the Ghostscript executable file
    <b>gswin64c.exe</b> on your hard drive in the text field for <b>Postscript
    Interpreter</b> <u>N</u>ame of Executable:.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fill out any other text fields in the form as you see fit (you can
    always come back to them later).</p>

      <p>At the beginning of this tutorial, you learned that the relationship
      between the output device resolution and the screen frequency determines
      the quality of the printed output. Depending on the output device you
      select, more than one screen frequency value may be available. Your
      printing professional will direct you to select the screen frequency
      appropriate to your artwork. Scribus makes the intelligent decision of
      300 dots per inch since this resolution value is used very commonly on
      standard printing machines. Your printing professional will direct you to
      select the screen frequency appropriate to your artwork if fine-adjusting
      screen and printer frequency is needed.</p>

    <h2>Creating a Trap</h2>
  </header>
<p><b>Trapping</b> is used to compensate for any gaps or color shifts that may
occur between adjoining or overlapping objects when printing. These gaps or
color shifts occur from misregistration, the result of the paper or the printing
plates becoming misaligned during printing. Trapping is a technique developed by
commercial print shops to slightly overprint the colors along common edges.</p>
<figure class = "ml-5 mr-5" style = "float: left;">
  <img src = "images/Misregistration.gif" alt = "Gap from misregistration" class
  = "img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Gap created by misregistration.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
  <img src = "images/LionTrapping.gif" alt = "Gap removed by trapping" class =
  "img-fluid">
  <figcaption>Gap removed by trapping.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div style = "clear: left;"></div>
<aside><p><b><i>About Traps</i></b></p>
  <p>When overlapping painted objects share a common color, trapping may be
  unnecessary if the color that is common to both objects creates an automatic
  trap. For example, if two overlapping objects contain cyan as part of their
  CMYK values, any gap between them is covered by the cyan content of the object
  underneath.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> When artwork contains common ink colors, overprinting does not
  occur on the shared plate &mdash; that is, the topmost overlapping printing
  ink appears opaque.</p>
  <p>There are two types of traps: a <i>spread</i>, in which a lighter object
  overlaps a darker background and seems to expand into the background; and a
  <i>choke</i>, in which a lighter background overlaps a darker object that
  falls within the background and seems to squeeze or reduce the object.</p>
  <figure class = "ml-5 mr-5" style = "float: left;">
    <img src = "images/Spread.gif" alt = "Spread trapping" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Spread: Object overlaps background.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Choke.gif" alt = "Choke trapping" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Choke: Background overlaps object.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div style = "clear: left;"></div>
  <p>Although Inkscape and Scribus don&rsquo;t have trapping functionality at
  this time of writing, you can still discuss both spreads and chokes with your
  professional printer.</p>
  <p>Your printer might recommend that you scale your graphic to its final size
  before a trap is added. The thickness of a trapping increases or decreases if
  you scale the object. For example, if a graphic has a 0.5-point trap and it is
  scaled up to five times its original size, the result is a 2.5-point trap for
  the enlarged graphic.</p>
</aside>
<p>Although trapping sounds simple enough, it requires a thorough knowledge of
color and design and an eye for determining where trapping is necessary. Your
professional printer can create a trap using two methods: by applying a trap
filter or trap effect, for simple artwork whose parts can be selected and
trapped individually; and by setting a stroke value for individual objects you
want to trap. Like printing, creating a trap is an art that requires time and
experience.</p>
<p>We will now consider a simple kind of trap called <b>overprinting</b>.</p>

  <header>
    <h2>Overprinting Objects</h2>
  </header>
  <p>When preparing an image for color separation, you can define how you want
  overlapping objects of different colors to print. By default, the top object
  in the Scribus artwork overprints, or lies ontop of, underlying artwork and
  prints with the color of the top object only.</p>
  <p>If, however, you use a technique that knocks out, or eliminates any
  underlying color, misregistration (gaps between colors) might occur, as you
  can see below.</p>
  <figure class = "ml-5 mr-4 col-md-4" style = "float: left;">
    <img src = "images/LionMisregistration.gif" alt = "Composite image with
    misregistration of the lion figure" class = "img-fluid">

    figure" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Second plate for the lion figure.</figcaption>
  </figure>
<div style = "clear: both;"></div>
  <p>You can also specify to your professional printer an object to
  <i>overprint</i>, or print on top of, any of the artwork under them.
  Overprinting is the simplest method you can use to prevent misregistration on
  press. The overprinted color automatically traps into the background
  color.</p>

  might want to change the amount of trap specified. It is much like changing
  the stroke thickness of a shape&rsquo;s border using the <b>Stroke</b>
  palette in Inkscape.</p>
  <p>Inkscape doesn&rsquo;t have trapping functionality, but Scribus does. If
  you want to explore what Scribus can do with trapping, choose Windows
  &gt; Properties. Then, select an image or image frame. You&rsquo;ll see a
  boundary appear around the image and the text in the <b>Properties</b> panel
  will change from grey (inactive) to black (activated).</p>
  <p>Click on the <b><u>C</u>olors</b> option and note the <b>Overprinting</b>
  field at the bottom of the dialog box. <b>Knockout</b> and <b>Overprint</b>
  are the two options available to you. This tutorial will not go any further
  with trapping because this subject is meant for printing, and working with
  printing machines and professional printers. Inkscape&rsquo;s focus is on
  graphic design.</p>

    <h2>Working with Two-Color Illustrations</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Two-color printing generally refers to black and one spot color, but may
  also refer to two spot colors. In addition to printing the two solid colors,
  you can print tints, or screens of the colors. Two-color printing is much less
  expensive than four-color printing and lets you create a rich range of depth
  and color when used effectively.</p>

    <h3>Editing a Spot Color</h3>
  </header>
  <p>In this section, you&rsquo;ll open a two-color version of a circus
  illustration containing black, a spot color, and tints and a shade of that
  spot color (the lion figure has been shaded). Before you separate the
  illustration, you&rsquo;ll replace the current PANTONE spot color with another
  PANTONE color.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Exit Scribus and start Inkscape.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Download art file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial20/Tutorial20_start2.svg"><b>Tutorial20_start2.svg</b></a>
    and save it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Open, and open the <b>Tutorial20_start2.svg</b>
    file.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Tutorial20_start2.gif" alt = "Tutorial20_start2 image
        file" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Tutorial20_start2 image file.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose File &gt; Save As, name the file <b>Twocolor.svg</b>, and
    save it in a convenient location.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Objects &gt; Fill and Stroke&hellip; and click on
    <b>Fill</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Using the Selection tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
    "Selection Tool icon" width = "26">), click any colored part of the circus
    tent. Notice the PANTONE_116_C swatch in the Color palette.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Tent.gif" alt = "Spot color" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Spot color.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Next, you&rsquo;ll replace every instance of the spot color (including any
  tints and shades of the color) with another spot color.</p>
  <ol start = "7">
    <li><p>The Swatches palette has three different views which you can use. In
    order to see the swatch color name and the swatch, choose View &gt;
    Swatches&hellip;. Click on the right-pointing arrow (<img src =
    "images/RightPointingArrow.gif" alt = "Right-pointing arrow" width = "26">)
    at the top right of the color grid and then click on <b>List</b> at the top
    of the drop-down menu. This view option provides you with a visual of the
    swatch, and its name or number. In the figure below, I have set the
    <b>Size</b> to <b>Medium</b>, the <b>Width</b> to <b>Medium</b>, and the
    <b>Border</b> to <b>Wide</b>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ListView.gif" alt = "List View" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Change the Swatch palette to List View in order to read<br>
        the swatch names.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Select &gt; Deselect or &lt;Ctrl&gt;-click, or click away from
    the artwork to deselect the tent.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Next, you&rsquo;ll replace the current PANTONE color with the new PANTONE
  color.</p>
  <ol start = "11">
    <li><p>With the Selection tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
    "Selection Tool icon" width = "26">), click any colored part of the circus
    tent, just as you had done in Step 4.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Choose Edit &gt; Select Same &gt; Fill Color.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectSameFillColor.gif" alt = "Selecting objects
        having the same fill color" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting objects having the same fill color. Note that
        colors that have been tinted or shaded are also selected.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>In the Swatches palette, click on swatch PANTONE_193_C. Almost all
    objects that were painted using spot color PANTONE_116_C are now painted
    with PANTONE_193_C, including all those objects that are tinted and shaded.
    Objects that have been tinted or shaded retain their tints and shades with
    the new spot color or hue. The only exception is the face and front of the
    acrobat.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/UpdatedPANTONE.gif" alt = "Updated image" class =
        "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Updated image.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>It is currently unknown whether this is a bug in Inkscape. There is a
    way around this idiosyncracy, however.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Select the front of the acrobat with the Selection tool (<img src =
    "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt = "Selection Tool icon" width = "26">).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/SelectFrontOfAcrobat.gif" alt = "Selecting the front
        of the acrobat" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Selecting the front of the acrobat.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now click on swatch PANTONE_193_C in the Swatches palette.</p>
    <p>The color of the acrobat&rsquo;s front changes from PANTONE_116_C to
    PANTONE_193_C. Notice that the white tinting is maintained.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ChangeColorOfAcrobatFront.gif" alt = "Changing the
        color of the front of the acrobat" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Changing the color of the front of the acrobat.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>You&rsquo;ve finished the lesson. In an ordinary workflow situation, you
  would now be ready to send your artwork to a commercial press to be printed.
  Include proofs of color separation setups when you send your electronic file
  to a printer. Also tell your printer about any traps you created in the
  artwork. Keep in mind that you must remain in close communication with your
  printing professional for each print job. Each print job has unique
  requirements that you must consider before you begin the process of color
  separation.</p>

    <h2>Review Answers</h2>
  </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Each color model has a gamut of color that overlaps, but does not
    precisely match the others. Because monitors display color using the RGB
    color gamut and printed artwork used the smaller CMYK color gamut, there
    might be times when a printed color cannot precisely match an on-screen
    color.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can select one of Inkscape&rsquo;s built-in color management
    profiles to better simulate the relationship betwen on-screen colors and
    printed colors. You can choose View &gt; Proof Setup and select an output
    device profile. Then choose View &gt; Proof Colors to get an on-screen
    version of how the artwork will look when printed to the selected
    device.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to print black-and-white drafts of your
    artwork on a desktop printer to check the layout and the accuracy of text
    and graphics in your publication before incurring the expense of printing
    to a color printer or imagesetter (for separations).</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Color separation refers to breaking down composite artwork into its
    component colors &mdash; for example, using the four process colors (cyan,
    magenta, yellow, and black) to reproduce a large portion of the visible
    color spectrum.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can convert a spot color to its process color equivalents if a
    precise color match is not required, or you can output a spot color to its
    own separation.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>One- or two-color printing is less expensive than four-color
    printing, and you can use spot colors for precise color matching.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Trapping is a technique developed by commercial print shops to
    slightly overprint the colors along common edges, and it is used to
    compensate for any gaps or color shifts that may occur between adjoining or
    overlapping objects when printed.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>You can specify objects to overprint, or print on top of, any of the
    artwork under them. Overprinting is the simplest method you can use to
    create a trap, which compensates for misregistration on press.</p>
