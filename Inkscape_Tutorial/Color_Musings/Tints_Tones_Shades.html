      printing press requires that attention be paid to details, such as
      brightness, contrast, gamma correction, the type of printer, and more, so
      that the printed result matches to satisfaction what you see on-screen.
      Applying tinting, tones, and shading to enhance or subdue colors is part
      of the process. The musings and theory presented below are directed to
      understanding what tint, tone, and shading are all about in a framework
      built on basic color theory, algebra, and geometry.</p>

    <h2>Defining Our RGB Color Space</h2>
  </header>
<div class = "row">
<section>
  <p>Consider a 3-D cube whose x, y, and z axes represent the <b>R</b>ed,
  <b>G</b>reen, and <b>B</b>lue color space, or <b>RGB</b> space. The origin, at
  point (0, 0, 0) represents black. Diagonally opposite the origin, across the
  cube, is point (255, 255, 255), which represents white. Each edge goes from 0
  to 255 in color values. There are 16,777,216 individual 24-bit color points
  contained in and on the cube that can be used to color an individual pixel.
  Because each pixel can be colored individually, we have available to us, as
  graphic artists, what feels like an infinity of image possibilities. The
  number of possibilities is huge to where your mind will melt, and yet it can
  be calculated and each color number can be manipulated with computer
  programming techniques. We see this capability in action with Inkscape.</p>

  <p>We can portray grayscale colors on the line segment that connects black at
  the cube&rsquo;s origin (0, 0, 0), to white at point (255, 255, 255), along
  the cube&rsquo; body diagonal.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Color Shading</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Consider a color, any color, inside the RGB color cube. I picked (235, 199,
  56), which is close to Bright Sun Yellow and RAL Zinc Yellow.</p>
  <p>If you have either of these colors as a paint, you add shading to the color
  by adding a drop of pure black paint to a small amount of the yellow and
  mixing thoroughly. To add more shading, you add another, and more drops of
  black paint, thoroughly mixing, until you achieve the degree of darkness that
  you are looking for (see <a href = "https://www.beachpainting.com/blog/color-hue-tint-tone-and-shade/"><b>Beach Painting Contractors</b></a>).</p>
  <p>You can create a shaded version of your original color by adding black
  in a drawing program, such as Inkscape. It is just like moving the point that
  represents your original color, here Bright Sun Yellow, straight towards the
  origin of the color cube, which represents black.</p>
  <p>Unlike your mixing bowl of paint, you can move your color point back and
  forth along the color path to adjust the degree of shading. With the paint,
  you can only add black paint. With Inkscape, you can both add and remove the
  black paint with a clear conscience.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Shading01.png" alt = "Shading path connecting your
    original Bright Sun Yellow color with black" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Shading path connecting your original Bright Sun Yellow color
    with black.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>As you move from Bright Sun Yellow to black, the mixed color will darken
  from 100% yellow to 100% black, going through all shades in between.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Shading02.png" alt = "Different shades of Bright Sun
    Yellow, going from the original color through to black" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Different shades of Bright Sun Yellow, including the end colors
    black and Bright Sun Yellow.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This color path that connects your original color to black can be
  reexpressed as a shading slider bar that you can adjust to integer precision
  (no real numbers &mdash; all color values are integer values).</p>
  <p>The degree of shading, the RGB code for the new shaded color, the code for
  black, and, finally, the code for your starting color are all related by an
  equation shown below as a color example. This equation is easy to translate
  into computer code that can then be made incarnate as an application dedicated
  to shading colors.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Color Tinting</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Color tinting works in the same way as with shading, except that now, we
  add pure white to our original color, instead of black (see <a href = "https://www.beachpainting.com/blog/color-hue-tint-tone-and-shade/"><b>Beach Painting Contractors</b></a>).
  The result is that we obtain a lighter, desaturated version of the original
  color. The color tint path, which is also a straight line, now takes us from
  the original color inside the RGB color cube to the far corner of the cube
  where white (255, 255, 255) is located.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tint01.png" alt = "Tinting path from our original color
    to the far corner of the color cube where pure white is located" class =
    "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Tinting path from our original color at P(235, 199, 56) to the
    far corner of the color cube where pure white (255, 255, 255) is
    located.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The tinting path is not a continuation of the shading path. When the color
  you want to shade or tint is off the grayscale path, the shading and tinting
  processes always take different paths from one another when it comes to color
  adjustment. They appear as two line segments having different points of origin
  and orientations in the figure below.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tint02.png" alt = "The tinting path is different from
    the shading path" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>The tinting path is different from the shading
    path.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Just as with the shading path, points along the tinting path give you
  different tints of the original Bright Sun Yellow (or any color), simulating
  different proportions of white with the yellow.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tint03.png" alt = "Different points along the tinting
    path yield different mixtures of white and Bright Sun Yellow" class =
    "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Different points along the tinting path yield different mixtures
    of white and Bright Sun Yellow.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The tint path can be reexpressed as a color slider bar that demonstrates
  how you can mix different percentages of white and, here, Bright Sun Yellow to
  to achieve a lighter, desaturated version of the original color. The equation
  that gives you the RGB code for the new desaturated color is shown under the
  bar in the figure below as an example of how values are used. Like the
  equation shown earlier for shading, it is a basic algebraic equation used in
  a 3-D space where <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> are replaced by RGB.</p>

  function. The tint function is accessed by choosing Filters &gt; Colors &gt;

    <h2>Introduction to Color Toning</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Color toning takes shading and tinting up a notch when it comes to color
  manipulation. Color toning is done by adding gray to your original color to
  subdue its hue, like shading with black and tinting with white. However, gray
  does not come as a single hue or pure color. You have light grays, medium
  grays, dark grays, off-white, off-black, and if you include black and white,
  there are 256 shades of gray on our RGB color cube&rsquo;s grayscale line.</p>
  <p>We won&rsquo;t work with black and white in this section because they are
  used separately in shading and tinting. Here, color toning involves strict
  grays whose gamut (color range) starts at (01, 01, 01) and ends at (254, 254,
  254), not (0, 0, 0) to (255, 255, 255).</p>
  <p>You will get a different range of colors to choose from when your color
  range ends (or starts) with a different shade of gray. Below is one tone line
  that start with a particular spot color and ends on a light gray. For example,
  the addition of light gray to your original color acts to subdue its
  intensity.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tone01.png" alt = "Toning a magenta color with light
    gray" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Toning a magenta color with light gray.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Now, keep the original color the same but change the gray tone to a darker
  gray. See how the range of color changes to subdued, and yet darker
  possibilities for your color palette.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tone02.png" alt = "Toning a magenta color with dark
    gray" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Toning a magenta color with dark gray.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Both ends of the color tone line can be changed. This flexibility of
  changing how light or how dark your starting gray color is <u>and</u> changing
  your starting spot color or hue requires working with two color gamuts: one
  gamut for the grayscale line and the other for your spot color or hue.</p>
  <p>The gray that you choose from the grayscale line becomes the new beginning
  for the tone scale line. You can now find a tone balance between a good gray
  and your original color to de-highlight the latter according to your
  vision.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tone03.png" alt = "Working with a grayscale gamut and
    spot color or hue gamut to give a color a tone" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Working with a grayscale gamut and spot color or hue gamut to
    give a color a tone.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>The figure below shows how a light spot color can be made more subdued
  with the judicious application of light gray to its toning gamut.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/Tone04.png" alt = "Working with a grayscale gamut and
    spot color or hue gamut to give a color a tone" class =
    "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Giving a lighter spot color a lighter gray tone.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Two color gamut slider bars can be coded and linked so that a result from
  the grayscale gamut slider is immediately applied to the beginning of the
  second tonal scale gamut for the spot color. Color tones, being defined by
  two slider bars, allow you to create subtleties in color intensity that
  suggest differences in depth, how the viewer should direct their attention,
  and elicit different moods and feelings.</p>
  <p>Percentages are for recording those selections of color that are important
  to your work.</p>

    <img src = "images/Tone05.png" alt = "How an Inkscape color toning
    application might look" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>How an Inkscape color toning application might
    look.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Working with color tones requires a feel for what works best for your
  artwork. As you experiment with different combinations of gray and spot color
  or hue, you will gain the experience and the intuition required to adjust
  colors freely, easily, and with confidence.</p>
