    <h2>Inkscape and Animation</h2>
  </header>
  <p>At the time of writing this tutorial (18 August 2021), Inkscape does not
  have the capabilities of producing animation. However, it can help you create
  the building blocks that go into animation. These building blocks include
  backgrounds and figures for later animation. Backgrounds and figures, though
  they are static images, can be imported into an animation program which can
  then create the type of motion you would see if you drew figures on
  consecutive pages in a writing pad, and then flipped the pages rapidly enough
  to simulate motion. In this case, you don&rsquo;t have to draw every single
  page. The computer does much of the tedious work of drawing and flipping the
  pages for you.</p>
</section>
<section>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You will work with the background first.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Download image file <a href = "https://github.com/Roy-Torley/Roy-Torley.github.io/blob/master/Inkscape_Tutorial/Tutorial19/Background_original.jpg"><b>Background_original.jpg</b></a>
    and store it in a convenient location.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/Background_original.jpg" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Original image for animation background. Dr. Alex McBirney
        looks out at us from specimen C.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This image is reproduced from a book on <u>Igneous Petrology</u>,
      written by Alexander McBirney. <u>Igneous Petrology</u> is an out-of-print
      university textbook about the chemistry and mineralogy of lavas that
      McBirney and colleagues obtained out in the field. Circles A, B, C, and D
      are drawings of thin slices of different lava rocks, called thin sections,
      used here in studying what different lava rocks look like under a
      microscope. McBirney hand-drew all of these images.</p>
      <p>As an experiment, Dr. McBirney also drew little cartoon caricatures of
      himself in several of the specimens. He wanted to test whether serious
      scientific publishing companies were indeed stringently careful in
      reviewing the books they were about to publish.</p>
      <p>Every little representation of the good professor made it through the
      review process unscathed, which makes one wonder about the power of close
      scrutiny of some book publishing companies. One such leprechaun peers out
      at us from specimen C.</p>
      <p>You will animate Dr. McBirney. He will puff a smoke ring out of his
      pipe and then wink at you.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>The background image is a jpg, that is, it is a bitmap image. You
    will convert it into a scaled vector graphic (.svg) file so that the
    animation program you&rsquo;ll be working with shortly can accept it.</p>

    <h2>Downloading and Installing the <i>enve</i> Animation Program</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Maurycy Liebner is developing an animation program, called <b>enve</b>
  that allows you to create two-dimensional vector and bitmap animation.
  Animations can also include sound and video. It is easy to download and
  install. The installer file is 82.5 megabytes in size, of moderate size for
  modern-day computers.</p>
  <p><b>enve</b> is not a video editor, such as <b>VSDC Video Editor</b> and
  <b>Openshot</b> (both are freeware video editing programs), but an animator,
  which is a different animal. It takes vector (svg) images that you create and
  and makes time-based changes to them as you desire. <b>enve</b>, for an aside,
  stands for:

      <h4>Note:</h4>
      <p><b>enve</b>&rsquo;s capabilities will not be explored in detail &ndash;
      that topic is outside the scope of this tutorial and well deserves its
      own stand-alone tutorial. Only those tools and techniques needed to draw
      the animation shown here will be touched upon. The point of this tutorial
      and project is to show you how Inkscape can contribute to the creation
      of animated 2-D graphic art in an easy-to-learn and easy-to-understand
      way.</p>
      <p>There are tutorials on how to use <b>enve</b> already on the Internet
      &mdash; most of them are video clips &mdash; and they can expand your
      imagination on what is <u>freely</u> available to you if you are
      interested in exploring this area of graphic arts further. <b>enve</b>
      has only recently been developed and is still undergoing refinement and
      expansion of its capabilities. As <b>enve</b> continues to grow, so will
      the number of tutorials available on how to use it; all of it free for you
      to download, learn, enjoy, and create.</p>

      <h2>Putting the Animation Together</h2>
    </header>
  <ol>
    <li><p>You&rsquo;ll start by importing the background upon which the
    animation will take place.</p>
    <p>Choose File &gt; Import File&hellip;, navigate to where you have file
    <b>Background.svg</b> stored, select it, and click on the <b>Open</b>
    button to open it. The background image appears after a few seconds.</p>
    </li>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ImportSVG.gif" alt = "Importing the original svg
        art file" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Importing the original svg art file.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>The <b>Object Mode</b> tool should be active by default when you
    first start <b>enve</b>. Hover the <b>Object Mode</b> tool cursor over a
    black area to activate the moving function. A black border appears
    indicating that the image can be manipulated.</p>
    <p>Click-drag the image to the center of the canvas. So far, tools work just
    as they do in Inkscape.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/MoveImage2Center.png" alt = "Moving the image to the
        center of the canvas" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Moving the image to the center of the canvas.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>You will now scale the image so that it fills the canvas. Here is
    where the scaling function differs from what Inkscape has.</p>
    <p>With the <b>Object Mode</b> cursor active, click on a black area in the
    image so that a black border appears around the whole image. The image is
    now manipulable.</p>
    <p>Press <b>S</b> to turn on scaling. A dashed line appears between the
    cursor and a circle with a cross inside it.</p>
    <p>This circle is called the image&rsquo;s <b>pivot point</b> (<img src =
    "images/PivotPoint.gif" alt = "Pivot Point" width = "26">). It acts as an
    origin from which an object can be resized, or about which an object can be
    rotated, hence pivot point.</p>
    <p>Without pressing any key, just pull the cursor away from the pivot point.
    The image expands. If the image is off-center, then turn off the scaling
    function by clicking the mouse, repositioning the mouse, and then pressing
    <b>S</b> again to turn scaling back on.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ScalingImage1.png" alt = "Pressing S to scale the
        image" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Pressing S to scale the image.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Move the image and rescale it until it fills the canvas. Play around
    with moving and rescaling the image so that you get a feel for how the two
    functions work.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ScalingImage2.gif" alt = "Pressing S to scale the
        image" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Pressing S to scale the image.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
    <li><p>Save your work by choosing File &gt; Save As&hellip;. When the
    <b>Save File</b> dialog box appears, name your animation file
    <b>GeniusAtWork</b>) so that the HTML page that you will embed it in later
    will recognize it, navigate to where you want to store it, and click on
    the <b>Save</b> button. <b>enve</b> automatically appends the extension
    <b>.ev</b> to the filename so that <b>enve</b> can recognize it as an
    <b>enve</b> file.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Now that you have a good idea of how to use both the moving and
    scaling functions, you will now use <b>enve</b>&rsquo;s zoom function.</p>
    <p>The zoom function is different from the scale function because it
    magnifies the whole canvas, not just a selected object. <u>Do note that</u>,
    when you scale an object, you are resizing it for the animation you intend
    to create. Zooming in on an object does not rescale it for the animation
    &mdash; it increases or decreases the magnification of whatever you are
    looking at, like a telescope or microscope, so that you can see details
    better that you need to see without resizing the image. So, scaling actually
    resizes images and image components, and you will see that resizing in the
    animation. Zooming should be used strictly for better viewing without
    changing the size of images for purposes of the animation.</p>
    <p>You zoom in by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-<b>+</b> (Control key and plus sign)
    and zoom out pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;-<b>-</b> (Control key and minus sign).
    For quick zooming, press the Control key and roll the mouse wheel. To
    return to the default magnification, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;-<b>0</b> (Control
    key and zero).</p>
    <p>Zoom in on Dr. McBirney using a combination of the move function and the
    zoom function. Don&rsquo;t use the scaling function with <b>S</b> because
    you will resize the background image. Zoom works as if you are looking more
    closely at what you&rsquo;re working on.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src = "images/ScalingImage3.gif" alt = "Pressing the Control key
        and rolling the mouse wheel to zoom in on McBirney" class = "img-fluid">
        <figcaption>Pressing the Control key and rolling the mouse wheel to zoom
        in on Dr. McBirney.</figcaption>
      </figure>

  <p>The Timeline is where all the kinetic action takes place. You can start an
  animation at one point in time, stop or pause it at another, change when
  things happen, and finally render everthing into a video clip. In this
  section, you will make the smoke ring that you drew appear out of Dr.
  McBirney's and float upwards, expanding out and fading as it goes.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The <b>Circle</b> object should be highlighted and a yellow disc
    should be visible under Time Frame <b>0</b>. If, however, you see
    <b>Group</b>, then the two images (background and smoke ring) are still
    grouped. Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G again. If you still see
    <b>Group</b>, then troubleshoot. Click on the <b>Group</b> label and then
    press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;Ctrl&gt;-G. The label should change into two labels:
    <b>Circle</b> and <b>layer1</b>.</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Because the smoke ring object is located in the Frame 0 column, the

    <h2>Final Thoughts on <i>enve</i>, Inkscape, and Animation</h2>
  </header>
  <p>You have now learned how to create a basic animation using Inkscape in
  conjunction with the <b>enve</b> 2-D animation program. There are other 2-D
  programs available on the Web. Not only that, there are 3-D programs, such as
  Anim8or, Art of Illusion, and last but not least, Blender, to broaden
  extend your frontier of what&rsquo;s possible in the graphic arts. There is
  more than enough to spend a lifetime on, enhancing your technical and creative
  skills and feeding your imagination.</p>
  <p>Inkscape&rsquo;s strength lies in its capabilities for drawing 2-D artwork
  with high quality that compares favorably with other drawing software
  available on the market. Although it does not offer animation, programmers
  and programming enthusiasts have made great strides in creating software that
  suggests that great things are already on the way to your desktop or laptop.
  <b>enve</b> is one of these shining new stars attracting the attention of
  many graphic artists who want to expand their horizons into the realm of art
  that moves.</p>
  <p>Because <b>enve</b> has many of the same drawing tools and features as
  Inkscape, it makes basic sense to consider it as a next reasonable step to
  take in your journey as a developing graphic artist. This tutorial is only
  meant to get you started on that road. There are other animation programs out
  there to choose from as your skill set and imagination grow and evolve.</p>
  <p>Use this tutorial as a way to start playing with animation possibilities
  and produce exciting new, fun and funny, meaningful, awe-inspiring, great art
   that is of your creation. There is still magic in this universe of ours!</p>
