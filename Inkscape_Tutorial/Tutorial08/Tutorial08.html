    <li>Change the opacity of objects.</li>
    <li>Use color blending modes.</li>
    <li>Use group options for transparency.</li>
    <li>Use color and opacity masking.</li>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
</header>
<p>In this lesson, you&rsquo;ll add transparency to artwork in several ways.
You can vary the degree of transparency of an object&rsquo;s fill or stroke (or
both), a group of objects, or a layer from 100% opacity (completely solid) to
0% opacity (completely transparent). When you decrease an object&rsquo;s
opacity, the underlying artwork becomes visible through that object as if you
were working with stained glass.</p>
<p>Using transparency features, you can also create special effects, such as
knocking out underlying colors or creating graduated transparencies or blends.
Transparency can be applied to multiple objects, groups, and even to entire
layers. In this lesson you will focus on the transparency and color blending
features and their capabilities. Learn how to apply transparency to layers in
Lesson 7, "Working with Layers."</p>

    <h2>Basic color blending and blending modes</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Color blending works with layers to produce its visual effects. When an
  object needs to have its own special see-through effect, it is best to have
  that object in its own layer. Several objects that use the same blending mode
  can be in the same layer for the sake of efficiency.</p>
  <p>You will create a layer and move the leftmost wave to that layer to see how
  blending modes work.</p>
  <aside><p><b>Note:</b> If you did not practice Tutorial 6, Working with
  Layers, I strongly recommend that you take time to become acquainted with
  layer techniques now. The material is this tutorial will be easier to work
  with.</p>

  <h3>Creating a Layer for Each Wave</h3>

    <li><p>Click on the <b>Add layer</b> plus sign icon (<img src =

    <li><p>When the <b>Add Layer</b> dialog box appears, type <b>Right wave</b>
    in the <b>Layer name</b> text box, keep the <b>Position</b> as <b>Above

    <li><p>Type <b>Middle wave</b> in the <b>Layer name</b> text box and keep

    <li><p>You will now move each wave into its own layer.</p>
    <p>With the Select tool (<img src = "images/SelectionTool.gif" alt =
    "Selection tool" width = "26">), click on the rightmost wave. Note that it
    is currently located in Layer 1.</p>
    <p>Press &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;PgUp&gt; to move the wave into the <b>Right
    wave</b> layer.</p>

  <h3>Exploring color blend modes</h3>
  <h4>Multiply</h4>
  <ol start = "8">
    <li><p>Select the left wave if it isn&rsquo;t already selected. The <b>Left
    wave</b> layer bar Layers panel should be highlighted. Click on the arrow
    at the right end of the <b>Blend mode</b> options bar and select
    <b>Multiply</b> from the dropdown option list.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/MultiplySelected.gif" alt = "Select the Multiply blend
      mode from the Blend Mode dropdown list." class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Select <b>Multiply</b> from the Blend Mode dropdown
      list.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <figure>
      <img src = "images/FirstWaveMultiplied.gif" alt = "Multiply color
      blending applied to leftmost wave" width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Result of applying the <b>Multiply</b> color blend mode to the
      leftmost wave.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p><b>Multiply</b> multiplies the underlying color with the overlapping
  object&rsquo;s color. The result is always a darker color. Multiplying any
  color with black produces black. Multiplying any color with white leaves the
  color unchanged. The effect is similar to drawing with multiple magic markers.
  This blending mode is used often for drop shadows.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
  <h4>Difference</h4>
<ol start = "9">
  <li><p>Select the middle (the <b>Middle wave</b> layer bar highlights),
  select <b>Difference</b> from the dropdown option list.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/DifferenceSelected.gif" alt = "Select the Difference
    blending mode" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Select the <b>Difference</b> blending mode.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/MiddleWaveDifference.gif" alt = "Difference color
    blending applied to middle wave" width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Result of applying the <b>Difference</b> color blend mode to the
    middle wave.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><b>Difference</b> creates the effect of seeing underlying objects as a
  color film negative. Using it subtracts either the overlaying color from the
  underlying color or the underlying color from the overlaying color, depending
  on which one has the greater brightness value. Blending with white inverts
  the underlying color values; blending with black produces no change.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
  <h4>Screen</h4>
<ol start = "10">
  <li><p>Select the left wave, then select <b>Screen</b> from the <b>Blend
  mode</b> dropdown option list.</p>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/ScreenSelected.gif" alt = "Select the Screen
    blending mode" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Select the <b>Screen</b> blending mode.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src = "images/RightWaveScreen.gif" alt = "Screen color
    blending applied to rightmost wave" width = "600" class = "img-fluid">
    <figcaption>Result of applying the <b>Screen</b> color blend mode to the
    right wave.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p><b>Screen</b> multiplies the inverse of the overlying and underlying
  colors. The resulting color is always a lighter color. Screening with black
  leaves the color unchanged, and screening with white produces white. The
  effect is similar to projecting multiple slide images on top of each
  other.</p>
  <p>As you can see, the portion of the right wave that overlies the white
  background is invisible. Only the top portion that overlies the background
  text shows.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>S</u>ave and <u>F</u>ile &gt; <u>C</u>lose.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Experiment with the other blending modes available in the dropdown list.
  If you want to undo a color blend, click on the object and then choose
  <b>Normal</b> from the <b>Blend mode</b> dropdown list in the Layers palette.

    <h2>Making an Opacity Mask</h2>

  <p>In this section, you will make a copy of the logo at the beginning of this
  tutorial. When you look at the logo closely, you will see that it is
  composed of four layers: one containing small type, one containing the wave
  shapes, one containing stripes, and one containing large type. You will start
  by creating the layer that houses the small type.</p>

    the original colors of the image. This effect increases contrast with the
    blend colors. The result is brighter, more highly saturated colors while
    reducing highlights. Color Burn blending with white produces no change.</p>
    <p>Practical uses in <b>Color Burn</b> blending include heightening
    brilliant colors of photogenic food dishes on a dark cloth or table
    background, sunset colors that contrast against a darkening landscape, or
    for putting greater focus on flowers in a display or on a bush or tree.</p>

<p>You have just concluded a tutorial where you became more closely acquainted
with transparency and color blending tools, and with their use in combination.
You also learned that the clipping tool &ldquo;cookie-cuts&rdquo; through
multiple layers to modify the borders of your artwork.</p>
<p>Try out different fonts for the logo text and different blending modes.
Rearrange the layers to get different results. A layer is the computer graphic
equivalent of tracing paper. Just as you can change the order in which you can
stack tracing paper as you create a piece of artwork, so can you change the
stacking order of layers as you try out different ideas. They exist to help you
develop and fine-hone your skills.</p>

  <h2>Review Answers</h2>
</header>
<ol>
  <li><p>Transparency and opacity are opposites of each other. Transparency
  has to do with how much you can see through an object (how transparent it is);
  opacity has to do with how much you can&rsquo;t see through an object, or how
  opaque it is.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Blending modes allow you to vary the way that colors in objects
  interact or blend with the underlying objects. Modes can be selected from the
  Blend mode dropdown menu in the Layers palette.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Yes, transparency and color blending can be combined to produce a
  broad range of design effects, such as images produced with stained glass,
  tracing paper, lighting effects, and more.</p>
